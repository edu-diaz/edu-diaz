# Hey!

I'm a **Software Infrastructure Engineer** with strong interest in **open-source** and **cloud-native technologies**. I design and build scalable, robust infrastructures and actively contribute to projects that drive innovation. Most of my work and open-source contributions are managed through my personal organization: [TrianaLab](https://github.com/TrianaLab) and you can also check my [portfolio](https://edudiaz.dev). ðŸ“©
